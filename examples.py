The outputs don't have the same shape as the inputs, and they don't appear to be somewhat edited copies of the input.

The inputs appear to consist of "noisy" segments which are either stacked on top of each other or side-by-side. In other words, they are either noisy columns or noisy rows. Each segment consists of exactly one color. These colors also appear in the output.

In two of the example inputs (inputs 2 and 3), there are horizontal segments (rows) which are stacked on top of each other. The outputs for these inputs are each single columns. The color of each cell in the output column is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the other example input (input 1), there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. The output for this input is a single row. The color of each cell in the output row is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the additional input, there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. This input matches the "noisy" segment pattern of the other inputs.

The transformation rule appears to be to identify the colors of the segments and then to stack them side-by-side if they are columns or on top of each other if they are rows.

My code will first need to determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments. Then, it will need to identify the colors of the segments and stack them side-by-side or on top of each other as appropriate.

How can I determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments? Inputs which consist of column segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal column of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the leftmost (or rightmost) column. Otherwise, the leftmost (or rightmost) segment wouldn't be contiguous. Similarly, inputs which consist of row segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal row of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the topmost (or bottommost) row.

So, to identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments, I can check if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color. If they do, then the input consists of column segments. Otherwise, the input consists of row segments.

I need to know the colors of the segments (in order). I know that the segments are contiguous. So, I can take any row/column which includes all of the segments and then deduplicate the colors in that row/column. The resulting list of colors will be the colors of the segments (in order). If the input consists of column segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of column segments, I want to look at any row. I'll use the top row. If the input consists of row segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of row segments, I want to look at any column. I'll use the left column.

The code should:

- Identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments. This can be done by checking if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color.
- Identify the colors of the segments (in order). This can be done by looking at the top row if the input consists of column segments and by looking at the left column if the input consists of row segments.
- If the input is columns, return a single row where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment. If the input is rows, return a single column where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, a teal (color 8) 2x2 square is removed from around the bottom left. The output contains a teal 2x2 square in a different position, so it appears as though the square has been moved. It was moved to the top left. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey (color 5) outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the teal 2x2 square used to be black (color 0) in the original input. The teal 2x2 square exactly matches the black 2x2 square that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. A fuchsia (color 6) 1x2 rectangle was removed from the top right. The output contains a fuchsia 1x2 rectangle in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the bottom right. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the fuchsia 1x2 rectangle used to be black in the original input. The fuchsia 1x2 rectangle exactly matches the black 1x2 rectangle that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. The rest of the cells in the input are unchanged, including a number of orange (color 7) cells.

In example 2, a green (color 3) L shape is removed from the middle left. The output contains a green L in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the top left. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the green L used to be black in the original input. The green L exactly matches the black L that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. A brown (color 9) rectangle was removed from the top right. The output contains a brown rectangle in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the bottom right. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the brown rectangle used to be black in the original input. The brown rectangle exactly matches the black rectangle that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. The rest of the cells in the input are unchanged, including a number of fuchsia cells.

In example 3, a purple (color 2) shape is removed from the top left. The output contains the same purple shape in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the bottom left. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the purple shape used to be black in the original input. The purple shape exactly matches the black shape that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. A teal (color 8) shape was removed from the bottom right. The output contains a teal shape in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the top right. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the teal shape used to be black in the original input. The teal shape exactly matches the black shape that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. The rest of the cells in the input are unchanged, including a number of yellow (color 4) cells.

The transformation rule appears to be to take whichever shapes can be used to fill in the gaps in the grey outlines and then move those shapes into the grey outlines. The colored shapes are removed from the old locations (replaced with black) and then the gap is filled in with the corresponding color. This is done while leaving everything else as is.

I should check this proposed rule and make sure it is unambiguous. Are there ever any cases where a different shape could have fit inside the grey outline? I should check example by example.

In example 1, are there any 2x2 squares other than the teal square? No. Are there any 1x2 rectangles other than the fuchsia rectangle? Yes, there is an orange 1x2 rectangle. So, the proposed rule is ambiguous in this case.

So, the rule can't just be to take any shape which fits in the grey outline and move it into the grey outline. I should analyze what's going on with the cells which aren't moved. The cells which aren't moved in example 1 are orange. There are multiple discontinuous orange cells while the teal and fuchsia shapes are unique and contiguous. So, the rule could be to move the contiguous shapes which have a unique color into the outline where they fit. I need to check this rule in the other examples. In example 2, the green and brown shapes are unique and contiguous while the fuchsia cells have multiple discontinuous groups. In example 3, the purple and teal shapes are unique and contiguous while the yellow cells are not. In the additional input, there is a unique orange shape and a unique yellow shape while there are multiple discontinuous groups of purple cells. There are exactly two gaps in the grey outlines. So, this rule is unambiguous here as well.

Ok, I now understand the rule. I need to identify the contiguous shapes which have a unique color and then move them into the corresponding void grey outline.

To implement this, I will:

1. Identify each grey outline. I can do this by finding all of the grey cells and then finding the contiguous grey groupings (which should correspond to each outline). This assumes that each grey outline is disjoint from the others. Is this assumption correct? Yes, it is correct. The grey outlines are disjoint from each other.
2. For each grey outline, I will find the black cells inside of it. Each grey outline is always rectangular, so I can find the bounding box of the grey outline and then find the black cells inside of the bounding box.
3. For each black shape inside of a grey outline, I will find the contiguous shape of the same shape but of a different color. I can do this by finding all of the cells of each color and then finding the contiguous shapes of each color. I will then check if each shape is the same shape as the black shape. I also need to check that the colored shape is the unique contiguous shape of that color.
4. I will then move the colored shape into the grey outline and replace the old location of the colored shape with black.
5. I will then return the new grid.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, the teal (color 8) shape is reflected across the vertical line at the left edge of the teal shape. There is also a yellow (color 4) shape below the teal shape which is unchanged.

In example 2, the teal shape is reflected across the vertical line at the right edge of the teal shape. The teal shape is different from the teal shape in example 1. There is also a yellow shape below the teal shape which is unchanged. The yellow shape is different from the yellow shape in example 1. However, it is just the reflection of the yellow shape in example 1.

In example 3, the teal shape is reflected across the vertical line at the left edge of the teal shape. The teal shape is different from the teal shape in example 1. There is also a yellow shape below the teal shape which is unchanged. The yellow shape is the same as the yellow shape in example 1.

In the additional input, there is a teal shape and there is also a yellow shape. The teal shape is different from the teal shape in example 1. The yellow shape is the same as the yellow shape in example 2 (which isn't the same as example 1).

The rule is to reflect the teal shape across a vertical line at the edge of the teal shape. I need to determine which side of the teal shape to reflect towards. Example 2 differs from examples 1 and 3 in which side the teal shape is reflected towards. Are there any salient commonalities between examples 1 and 3 which differ from example 2? Yes, the yellow shape is the same in examples 1 and 3. The yellow shape is different in example 2. So, the orientation of the yellow shape determines which side the teal shape is reflected towards.

If the yellow shape is:
4|0|0
4|4|4
0|4|0

Then the teal shape is reflected towards the left. If the yellow shape is:
0|0|4
4|4|4
0|4|0

Then the teal shape is reflected towards the right.

The yellow shape always appears in the middle in the bottom 3 rows, so it should be easy to check what orientation it is in. Then, I just need to reflect the teal shape based on the orientation of the yellow shape. If it is the first orientation, I reflect towards the left. If it is the second orientation, I reflect towards the right.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, the two teal (color 8) cells are connected by a green (color 3) line. The line is horizontal and connects the two teal cells.

In example 2, the four teal cells are connected by green lines. The lines are vertical and connect the teal cells in pairs.

In example 3, the four teal cells are connected by green lines. The lines are horizontal and connect the teal cells in pairs.

In example 4, the two teal cells are connected by a green line. The line is vertical and connects the two teal cells.

In example 5, there is only one teal cell, so no green line is added.

In example 6, the two teal cells are not connected by a green line. This is because the teal cells are not aligned horizontally or vertically.

In example 7, the three teal cells are connected by a green line. The line is vertical and connects the teal cells in pairs.

In example 8, the five teal cells are connected by green lines. The lines are vertical and horizontal and connect the teal cells in pairs.

The rule is to connect the teal cells with green lines if they are aligned horizontally or vertically. If they are not aligned, no green line is added.

To implement this, I will:

1. Identify the teal cells.
2. Check which pairs of teal cells are aligned horizontally or vertically.
3. For each pair of teal cells that are aligned horizontally or vertically, add a green line connecting them. The green line should fill in the cells in between the teal cells (but should not overwrite the teal cells).
4. Return the new grid.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1:

- A new brown (color 9) cell replaces one of the teal (color 8) cells on the top left corner of a teal rectangle.
- A new fuchsia (color 6) cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom left corner of the rectangle.
- A new yellow (color 4) cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom right corner of the rectangle.

The grid is otherwise unchanged.

The input for example 1:

- It has a teal rectangle in the middle.
- It has a brown cell directly above the teal rectangle.
- It has a fuchsia cell directly to the left of the teal rectangle.
- It has a yellow cell directly below the teal rectangle.
- The brown cell is directly above the new brown cell (in the same column).
- The fuchsia cell is directly to the left of the new fuchsia cell (in the same row).
- The yellow cell is directly below the new yellow cell (in the same column).

In example 2:

- A new orange (color 7) cell replaces a teal (color 8) cell on the top of the teal rectangle.
- A new fuchsia cell replaces a teal cell on the top left corner of the rectangle.
- A new purple (color 2) cell replaces a teal cell on the middle right side of the rectangle.
- A new green (color 3) cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom left corner of the rectangle.
- A new blue (color 1) cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom right corner of the rectangle.

The input for example 2:

- It has a teal rectangle in the middle.
- It has an orange cell directly above the new orange cell (in the same column).
- It has a fuchsia cell directly to the left of the new fuchsia cell (in the same row).
- It has a purple cell directly to the right of the new purple cell (in the same row).
- It has a green cell directly to the left of the new green cell (in the same row).
- It has a blue cell directly below the new blue cell (in the same column).

In example 3:

- A new yellow cell replaces a teal cell on the top left corner of the teal rectangle.
- A new fuchsia cell replaces a teal cell on the top right corner of the rectangle.
- A new purple cell replaces a teal cell on the left side of the rectangle.
- A new orange cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom left corner of the rectangle.
- A new purple cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom right corner of the rectangle. This is a different change than the prior purple cell.
- A new green cell replaces a teal cell on the left side of the rectangle.

The input for example 3:

- It has a teal pixel in the middle.
- It has a yellow/fuchsia/purple/orange/purple/green cell in the same column/row as the new cell with the matching color.

The input for the additional example:

- It has a teal rectangle in the middle.
- It has various colored pixels around the teal rectangle.

Given these observations, we can infer the transformation rule:

1. Identify a central shape (namely the teal rectangle).
2. Look for colored cells which aren't part of the central shape.
3. For each colored cell found around the central shape, replace a single cell on the edge of the central shape.
4. If the colored cell is above/below the central shape, replace the top/bottom (respectively) cell in the same column on the central shape with the colored cell.
5. If the colored cell is to the left/right of the central shape, replace the left/right cell in the same row on the central shape with the colored cell.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1, the input has a purple outline forming a square with an inner black region. The output has the same purple outline but the inner region has been filled with blue. The change in this case is filling the innermost black region with blue.

In example 2, the input has a more complex purple shape with several inner black regions. The output shows that the innermost black region of a continuous block of black cells, bounded by purple cells, has been filled with blue. There is a another black region in the input in the top left corner which is surronded by purple cells but which also touches the edge of the grid. This region is not filled with blue in the output. So, the transformation seems to be to fill the black regions which are fully bounded by purple cells with blue. It doesn't count if the black region touches the edge of the grid and thus isn't fully bounded by purple cells.

In example 3, the input is a more extended purple border. The inner black regions bound by purple cells are filled with blue. There is a black region in the bottom right which borders the bottom edge of the grid. This region is not filled with blue in the output.

The transformation consists of:

1. Identifying regions fully enclosed by purple cells. (Not including regions that touch the edge of the grid.)
2. Filling the identified regions with blue (color 1).

Let's break it down into steps and ensure the analysis and transformation rules are clear:

1. **Region Identification**:
   - Identify all black regions (0) enclosed by purple cells (2).
   - Ensure the black regions do not touch the edge of the grid, since such regions are not enclosed entirely by purple cells.

2. **Filling the Regions**:
   - Replace all the cells in the correctly identified black regions with blue (1).

To efficiently find all connected components in the grid and check if they are completely enclosed by purple cells, we can use the concept of connected components using BFS or DFS and boundary checks.

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. For each black region, use BFS or DFS to explore the connected component of black cells (0).
2. Check if the boundary of the connected component only consists of purple cells (2).

The outputs don't match the shapes of the inputs. The outputs are an edited subset of the input. At least they appear to be that.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1:

- The input contains two purple (color 2) rectangles.
- The input contains various yellow (color 4) cells scattered around.
- The output is the larger purple rectangle extracted but just the inside extracted and with an added yellow border around the extracted insides.

In example 2:

- The input contains two blue (color 1) rectangles.
- The input contains various green (color 3) cells scattered around.
- The output is the larger blue rectangle extracted but just the inside extracted and with an added green border around the extracted insides.

In example 3:

- The input contains three green (color 3) rectangles.
- The input contains various purple (color 2) cells scattered around.
- The output is the larger green rectangle extracted but just the inside extracted and with an added purple border around the extracted insides.

By comparing the outputs and descriptions of the inputs, the inferred transformation rule can be described as:

1. Identify the color group outlines (the rectangles).
2. Extract the cells within the largest rectangle and find the dimensions of the included area (removing the outer border).
3. Add a colored border (based on the scattered colored points inside and outside the boundary) around the identified outlined region.
4. Return the new grid.

The output images are always filled with borders that contain a single color and a colored outline.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs, and the cells are essentially rearranged. Let's analyze each example to see if we can identify the systematic transformation rule.

**Example 1:**

- The columns in the input matrix have been swapped, giving a specific transformation.
- The first column in the output is the last column of the input.
- The last column in the output is the first column of the input.
- The middle columns are flipped.
- The columns are flipped over the center vertical line.

**Example 2:**

- The same pattern is observed.

**Example 3:**

- The columns are swapped again, which follows the same transformation rule derived for previous examples.

The transformation rule is to flip the columns over the center vertical line. The first column becomes the last column, the last column becomes the first column, the second column becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.

        code="""
def transform(grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    # Reverse the columns, flipping over the center vertical line
    transformed_grid = np.fliplr(grid)

        demonstrations=[],
    ),
    Example(
        id="2dc579da",
        reasoning="""
The outputs have variable sizes and are significantly smaller than the inputs.

The outputs appear to each contain a colored cell from the inputs. The rest of the cells in the outputs contain the color which was directly adjacent to the cell.

I'll reason through examples in further detail to infer the transformation rule.

In Example 1:
- The input grid has a yellow (4) cell at the bottom left corner (row 4, column 0).
- The adjacent color to this cell, to its immediate right, is teal (8).
- The output grid contains this yellow cell and the rest of the cells are teal (8).

In Example 2:
- The input grid has a single blue (1) cell at position (row 1, column 5).
- The adjacent color to this cell is always yellow (4).

In Example 3:
- The input grid has one teal (8) cell located at (row 2, column 1).
- All the adjacent colors around it are light green (3).

The rule seems to be to identify a unique color cell in a larger square formed by a larger colored cross-shape. Then, the output grid size matches the size of this larger square. The output grid includes all the cells that were in the surrounding square.

Let's deduce clear steps:
1. Identify the unique color cell which occurs only once (S).
2. Identify the surrounding color (C) adjacent to S.
3. Find the square which surrounds S (where other cells are colored with C). This square can be found by expanding from S in all directions until the color changes from C or an edge is reached.
4. Return a grid with the contents of this square. The output grid size will match the size of this square.
