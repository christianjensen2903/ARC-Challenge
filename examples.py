**Demonstration 1**
Reasoning:
We see that both the input and output consist of yellow, green and white cells which also happens to be the amount of cells in the output.
If we look at the colors ordered from left to right we see they have the same ordering of colors.

Hypothesis:
The output are the distinct colors in the input ordered from left to right.

**Demonstration 2**
Reasoning:
We can see our theory doesn't hold for the second demonstration. As the colors left to right depending on which row only consist of 1 or two colors where as the output consist of 3 distinct colors.
However if we look at the output we can see that the colors are ordered vertically instead of horizontally.
If we then look at the colors ordered from top to bottom in the input we see they have the same ordering of colors.
How do we figure out if it's top to bottom or left to right based on the input?
We can see if we look at the top row of the input. If it consist of 1 color it's top to bottom. If it consist of 2 or more colors it's left to right.

Hypothesis:
The output are the distinct colors in the input ordered from either top to bottom or left to right depending on how many colors the top row consists of.

**Demonstration 3**
Reasoning:
Our hypothesis seems to be valid for the third demonstration.

Hypothesis:
No changes from the previous demonstration.

Final theory:
The output are the distinct colors in the input ordered from either top to bottom or left to right depending on how many colors the top row consists of.

The code should:
1. Look at the top row of the input to determine left to right or top to bottom.
2. Identify the colors and their ordering based on the direction.
3. Output the colors in the correct ordering in the correct direction.

**Demonstration 1**
Reasoning:
We can see that the input and output mostly consist of the same shapes in the same locations.
However there seems to be a two shapes missing: The white square and the grey rectangle.
However if we look closer we can see that they are actually not missing, but rather moved.
We see that we have the same large purple shapes in both the input and output.
In the input we can see there are "holes" in the purple shapes that is then filled with the white square and the grey rectangle.
Why these shapes?
We can see that the white square has the same size as the "hole" in one of the purple shapes and the grey has the same size as the "hole" in the other.
So it seems it "fills" the whole in the purple shapes with shapes of the same size.
However we see that there is an orange shape with the same size as the grey rectangle.
Why is the grey rectangle chosen over the orange?
The rule could be that it choose the shape that is closest.

However let's keep looking for other patterns.
If we look at the colors of the shapes excluding the purple ones we see there is 6 shapes. 1 white, 1 grey and 4 orange.
So the pattern could also be to choose the shapes that have a distinct color.

Both rules seems to apply and seems like logical rules.
We will choose the second rule since it seems to be a more destinct pattern.

Hypothesis:
The purple shapes are filled with the shapes that have a distinct color.

Our hypothesis seems to be valid for the third demonstration.

Hypothesis:

**Demonstration 3**
Reasoning:

Hypothesis:

Final theory:
The purple shapes are filled with the shapes that have a distinct color.

The code should at high level:
1. Identify the two shapes with distinct colors.
2. Identify the purple shapes.
3. Identify the shapes of the "holes" in the purple shapes.
4. Move the shapes that have a distinct color to the "holes" in the purple shapes.

The code should at low level:
1. Identify unique colors
2. Find contiguous shapes of each color
3. Find shapes with a distinct color
4. Identify the purple shapes
5. Copy the input grid to the output grid
6. Iterate over the purple shapes
7. Find the bounding box of the purple shape
8. Find the "hole" in the purple shape
9. Find the shape with a distinct color that has the same shape as the "hole"
10. Iterate over the shapes with a distinct color
11. Normalize the shape and the hole to row 0 and col 0 to being able to compare with the "hole"
12. Check if the normalized shape and the normalized hole are the same
13. Set the hole to the color of the shape
14. Set the old location of the shape to black
15. Return the new grid

**Demonstration 1**
Reasoning:
We see that the yellow shape is present in both the input and output.
We also see that the white shape is present in both.
We however also see a new shape is added to the output. This seems to be the reflection of the white shape where is has been reflected to the left.
So it seems that the output is the same as the input but where the white shape is reflected to the left aswell.

Hypothesis:
The output is the same as the input but the white shape is reflected to the left.

**Demonstration 2**
Reasoning:
We see that the yellow and white shapes again is the same in the input and output.
It also seems like there is added a reflection this time. However this time the white shape is reflected to the right instead of to the left.
Why can this be?
Maybe it has something to do with shape of the white shape?
If we look at the first demonstration the left side is 1 cell and the right side is 3 cells.
It could be that is reflection depends on the length of the side.
If we look at the second demonstration the left side is 2 cells and the right side is 2 cells.
It could then be that it is reflected on the side with the shortest length.

Hypothesis:
The output is the same as the input but the white shape is reflected to either the left or right depending on which side is the shortest of the white shape.

**Demonstration 3**
Reasoning:
We can see that our theory with shapes appearing in the input and output is still valid.
This time it is reflected to the left. If we look a the length of the sides we see that the left side is 2 cells and the right side is 1 cell.
It therefore seems like our theory doesn't work for the third demonstration.

Let's see if we can figure out a new rule.
Let's look at the first demonstration again.
If we look at the yellow shape we can see that the left side is 2 cells and the right side is 1 cell.
It could then be that is it reflected based on the shape of the yellow shape.
Let's look at the second demonstration.
This time we can see that the yellow shape has a length of 1 cell on the left side and 2 cells on the right side.
It could therefore be that the white shape is reflected based on the longest side of the yellow shape.

Let's look at the third demonstration.
This time the yellow shape has a length of 2 cells on the left side and 1 cell on the right side.
Our theory therefore still holds.

Hypothesis:
The output is the same as the input but the white shape is reflected to either the left or right depending on which side is the shortest of the yellow shape.

Final theory:
The output is the same as the input but the white shape is reflected to either the left or right depending on which side is the shortest of the yellow shape.

Reasoning:
We see that the two white dots are present at the same location in the input and output.
The pattern could be that the two white dots are connected by a blue line.

Hypothesis:
The output is the same as the input but the two white dots are connected by a blue line.

**Demonstration 2**
Reasoning:
We see that there this time is 4 white dots and also is at the same location in the input and output.
However we can see that they are not all connected to each other.
How do we know which white dots we should connect?
On the first demonstration it is simple. We connect the two white dots.
On the second demonstration it makes sense to connect the dots that are in the same column since the lines else couldn't be straight.

The output is the same as the input but the white dots one the same row or column are connected by a blue line.

Reasoning:
We can see that both the input and output contain the same three distinct colored cells colored brown. grey and yellow.
We can also see that the input and output both contain a white rectangle where it in the output is partially covered by 3 cells with the same 3 distinct colors.
If we look at the position it looks like they are directly projected onto the white rectangle in the middle.

Hypothesis:
The output is the same as the input but the 3 distinct colored cells are in addition also projected onto the white rectangle in the middle.

Our hypothesis mainly seems to be valid for the second demonstration with one caveat. There is not only 3 distinct colored cells in the output but 5.

The output is the same as the input but the distinct colored cells are in addition also projected onto the white rectangle in the middle.

**Demonstration 1**
Reasoning:
We can see that output shape is also present in the input.
In the input is however colored both green and yellow where in the output is it only yellow.
Why is it the yellow color and not green?
It might be due to the boundary color of the shape is green where the interior is yellow.
How do we know which shape to choose from the input?
Based on the input logical choices could be either of the green rectangles, so why is it the one on the left?
Might be because it is bigger than the one on the right.
Could also be because it has something inside it which then choose the color change.
We will go with the latter option since it would make the color changing rule more consistent.

Hypothesis:
The green rectangle with some interior is copied to the output and the boundary of the shape is colored the same color as the interior.

**Demonstration 2**
Reasoning:
Our hypothesis seems to mostly be valid. However this time the chosen shape is red and not green.
So the choice must be independent of the color of the rectangles.
This time both rectangles however have something inside them. However the one that is chosen has "more" inside it.
It however still could be the largest shape.

Hypothesis:
The rectangle with the most cells inside it is copied to the output and its boundary is colored the same color as its interior.

Reasoning:
Our hypothesis seems to be valid.

Hypothesis:
No changes from the previous demonstration.

Final theory:
The rectangle with the most cells inside it is copied to the output and its boundary is colored the same color as its interior.

Code implementation:
To make it easier to find rectangles we could just relax this to find continous shapes instead and see how many other colored cells there is within its bounds.

The code should:
1. Find all continous shapes
2. Find the one with the most other colored cells within its bounds

However we can see that the cross again divides the grid into 4 squares where the output is the one with more than 1 distinct colored cell.

Hypothesis:
The input is divided into 4 square by a cross where the output is the square with more than 1 distinct colored cell.

**Demonstration 3**
Reasoning:
Our hypothesis seems to be valid.

Hypothesis:
No changes from the previous demonstration.

Final theory:
The input is divided into 4 square by a cross where the output is the square with more than 1 distinct colored cell.

The code should:
1. Divide the grid into 4 squares by a cross
2. Return the square with the most other colored cells within its bounds
