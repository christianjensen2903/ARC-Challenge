- Try to give image (check cost vs. accuracy)
- Try to give standard library (look at previous solutions and video of team)
- Try to mess with base prompt
    - Try to give shape sizes
    - Try to look for shapes that are in both input and output i.e. if in input check if also in output and vice versa

- Make "beam" search. Reitereate on the best solutions n times or a solution is found
- Majority vote on solutions that are equally good (kind of self-consistency)
- Recolor inputs. Maybe more advanced as in https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/discussion/154597
- Maybe flip inputs. Would maybe make it easier to see what column and rows
- Bucket examples into same grid size or not same grid size
