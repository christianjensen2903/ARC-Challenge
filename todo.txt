- Extract shapes that has something in common in the input & output and explain the difference
- Give it images. Maybe highlight the differences
- Try to give image (check cost vs. accuracy)

- Try to reread the question

- Try to give standard library (look at previous solutions and video of team)

- Make "beam" search. Reitereate on the best solutions n times or a solution is found
- Majority vote on solutions that are equally good (kind of self-consistency)
- Recolor inputs. Maybe more advanced as in https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/discussion/154597
- Maybe flip inputs. Would maybe make it easier to see what column and rows
- Bucket examples into same grid size or not same grid size

- Try instead of for example doing 128 with the same input. Split into "smaller" batches where they all have the same random flip/rotation/shuffle of demonstrations
